<h1>Effective communication</h1>
<!-- 3-2 -->
<p>As the world becomes more integrated, the threat of disease outbreaks
has become an increasing public health concern.</p>
<p>The widespread availability of media and communication platforms and
tools risks worsening this threat by creating conducive conditions for
the spread of misinformation, conspiracy theories and cynicism about
public health messages. Scientific evidence and data are important to
overcoming harmful information and other barriers that impede
communication on health behaviours. This week we will cover the skills
required for effective communication of scientific evidence and how to
apply them to engage different audiences. We will address topics such as
understanding effective communication, preparing to communicate with
different audiences, crafting messages according to purpose, choosing
channels for different purposes, and dealing with the media.</p>
<p><strong>What is effective communication?</strong></p>
<p>Communication is best positioned to achieve its purpose when the
communicator understands:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The meaning of effective communication.</p></li>
<li><p>The interdependent roles of senders and receivers in ensuring
meaning is mutually understood.</p></li>
<li><p>How to anticipate and overcome barriers to effective
communication of scientific evidence.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preparing to communicate with different
audiences</strong></p>
<p>Effective communication requires an understanding of how unique
characteristics inform the information needs and response behaviours of
different audiences. The communicator must be aware of the importance of
audience segmentation, the information and media habits of different
audiences, and how their beliefs, perceptions, knowledge, and attitudes
inform their responses to health recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting messages according to purpose</strong></p>
<p>Different audiences have different needs when it comes to messaging
on scientific data of public health importance. It is essential that the
goal or outcome intended informs the nature and content of messages.
Effective communication will incorporate different types of messages,
including informative, persuasive, and instructional. The communicator
also needs to understand the importance of matching audience needs to
message types and the complementarity of verbal and non-verbal cues in
ensuring message clarity and effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing channels for different purposes and
audiences</strong></p>
<p>Different audiences have different information habits and practices
that determine the channels and platforms they prefer to receive and
send information. Individual channels also have different
characteristics and capacities that will make some better suited for a
specific communication activity than others. When selecting the
appropriate channels, the communicator should consider the strengths and
weaknesses of the channel, the importance of matching audience habits
and needs with channel characteristics and making channel choices based
on the goals underpinning the communicative action.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with the media</strong></p>
<p>The media are a double-edged sword, with the power to both help and
hurt the realisation of public health outcomes. Scientific data and
information must be used to leverage the opportunities that the media
offer. Thus, it is important to understand how the media work and its
implications for the effective communication of scientific evidence and
learn how to both engage the media as allies and use the media to reach
public audiences.</p>

<h1>Communicating with the public</h1>
<!-- 3-4 -->
<p>For several years, pathogen genomics has informed public health
responses to infectious diseases, as well as the global health response
to disease outbreaks and epidemics. The COVID-19 pandemic has
highlighted not only the importance of pathogen genomics in epidemics
but also that there is a need to focus on effective communication of
pathogen genomic data. This information must be properly communicated by
healthcare professionals, scientists, policymakers and the media, and it
should consider the current context and happenings.</p>
<p>In most cases of infectious disease control, communication strategies
have mainly focused on the individual and involve one-to-one
communication between the healthcare provider and the individual about
the diagnosis and treatment plan. However, with advances in genomics
sequencing, it is likely that diagnosis for an infectious disease that
may have genomic information of the infectious agent (pathogen) will be
available as part of the diagnosis. How the healthcare provider
communicates this information to their client may have an impact not
only on the individual (e.g. their privacy) but also on their community.
For example, take the case where HIV testing and surveillance also
reveal hotspot areas. This could lead to stigmatisation and
discrimination of people in that community, which is likely to be worse
for those who are already part of stigmatised or marginalised
groups.</p>
<p>Public engagement and communication of pathogen genomic information
during disease outbreaks is key to the public health response.
Generally, the public health responses to disease outbreaks are aimed at
effective containment of the outbreak through:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bringing it to an end as soon as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking care of those affected by the outbreak.</p></li>
<li><p>Contact tracing and surveillance to identify new cases or disease
hotspots.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking care of people who have become ill from the infectious
agent and preventing new cases of the disease.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Information about these public health measures should therefore be
included in messages to the public. More recently, genomic information
about the causative pathogen may be included in the first announcements
of an outbreak or a new strain of concern.</p>
<p>Public communication and engagement strategies during an outbreak
response would ideally involve a mix of media approaches (e.g. print
media, radio, TV, social media, press releases from various
stakeholders, announcements in community and religious gatherings), seek
to engage diverse stakeholders and be tailored to each stakeholder group
(e.g. children of school going age, healthcare workers, policymakers).
It is also worth noting that social media has transformed public
engagement and communication in science, as well as how people consume
information. Irrespective of the engagement and communication strategy
that will be used, it must be designed and implemented following good
practices.</p>
<p><strong>Best practices for public engagement and communication during
outbreaks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have a pre-existing public engagement and communication plan;
identify key stakeholders, and define the role and responsibilities of
each stakeholder.</p></li>
<li><p>Build public trust in the public health system; empathic
messaging and communicating style, including honesty in situational
reports and the expertise of the messenger, are key.</p></li>
<li><p>Be transparent about outbreak origins, new strains, progress and
uncertainties, what is known and unknown, public health measures that
will be used and why, and the different methods public officials will
use for communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Respect public concerns about the outbreak.</p></li>
<li><p>Be sensitive to local practices and culture.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the unpredictability of outbreaks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, communication of pathogen genomic information will be
shaped by a variety of factors, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Political climate (democratic vs authoritative governments) will
determine the flow and depth of information that can be covered during
public engagement and communication.</p></li>
<li><p>Economic resources where there are fewer resources to support
outbreak response, national governments may want to limit media coverage
for fear of raising public anxiety or causing economic disruption by
being forced to adopt certain measures, such as lockdowns.</p></li>
<li><p>International diplomacy may influence reporting of new outbreaks
and or new strains of concern. Some countries may fear discrimination of
citizens at the global level or that reporting of genomic information
may easily link them to the origins, thereby leading to
discrimination.</p></li>
<li><p>Availability of public health authorities and scientists to
communicate and respond to public concerns without heightening
anxiety.</p></li>
<li><p>Cultural context and behavioural patterns of
communities.</p></li>
<li><p>Public literacy/knowledge about the infectious agent or disease.
For example, the communication strategy for Ebola in many West African
countries today would be very different from that of a new emerging
infectious disease.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is worth noting that whilst public communication of pathogen
genomic information during disease outbreaks is key to the global health
response, it can fuel public anxiety and lead to the stigmatisation of
certain groups. It also needs to be recognised that competition amongst
scientists, media houses and institutions to be the first to report on
an outbreak or a new strain can lead to exaggeration of the outbreak and
control measures, perpetuate discrimination, increase public anxiety,
and lead to a breakdown of public trust in science.</p>
<p>To conclude, it is important for scientists, public health officials
and media personnel to have some understanding of how their communities
or the public perceive risks during disease outbreaks, and to frame
their messages with these perceptions in mind.</p>

<h1>Informing public health professionals: Viet Nam case study part
1</h1>
<!-- 3-7 -->
<p>To examine how research impacts policy-making and what lessons we
have learnt as scientists and policymakers from the pandemic, we are
going to focus on a case study from Viet Nam’s <a
href="https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/research/oucru">Oxford
University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU)</a>. In the first part of this
case study, we will think about how scientific evidence is used to
inform policy.</p>
<p>OUCRU, with more than 30-year experience in conducting health
research in Viet Nam, has set a new vision of having a local, regional,
and global impact on health by leading a locally driven research
programme on infectious diseases in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>By reviewing Ministry of Health guidelines, case studies and
conducting interviews with key stakeholders, the team at OUCRU were able
to begin to understand the policy development processes, how to use
evidence in decision-making, challenges and opportunities to policy and
research engagement, as well as how to improve engagement between
policymakers and research communities.</p>
<p>OUCRU found several factors that increased the likelihood of
policymakers’ accepting research findings including the timeliness of
research, the relevance of topics, accessibility of research results,
unequivocal nature of findings, quality of research methods and
long-term trusted collaborations.</p>
<p>Apart from government officials and local authorities, other key
informants like international organisations, local non-governmental
organisations, civil society organisations, or activists also had a role
in each step of the policy development process. For advocacy approaches
to be successful they needed researchers to build their capacity and
understanding of policy processes, to engage early with policymakers and
over the whole course of a study, and use explicit and systematic
advocacy approaches and engage in frequent communication.</p>
<p>Policy development in Viet Nam is continuous with scientists and
management institutions participating in the process. In the past ten
years, improvements in how genomic evidence is used, and the involvement
of scientists, have resulted in better application of research results
into health care and public health practice. Policy development was fast
and Viet Nam had better access to updated information globally. However,
obstacles still existed: time pressure, lack of information, limited
capacity, and lack of standard procedures for policy development caused
difficulties in the policy formulation process.</p>
<p>Policies in Viet Nam were found to be evidence-informed but
influenced by other considerations such as contextual factors and
available resources. Policymakers selected evidence for decision-making
based on the strength of evidence, the quality of research studies, the
appropriateness with the context of Viet Nam, and the source of
evidence.</p>
<p>However, the engagement between researchers and policymakers is not
particularly close in Viet Nam. The two communities saw things
differently and had different priorities. Researchers’ unwillingness to
share data, policymakers’ time constraints and the high rate of staff
turnover were commonly mentioned as obstacles.</p>

<h1>Engaging with policymakers: Viet Nam case study part 2</h1>
<!-- 3-8 -->
<p>The team at <a
href="https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/research/oucru">Oxford
University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU)</a> developed a series of
recommendations based on their work that may be relevant in many
different contexts. They conducted a series of in-depth interviews
between November 2019 and March 2020, so it’s helpful to remember that a
lot of these issues are not unique to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, but can
be considered for a variety of pathogen outbreaks.</p>
<p>OUCRU’s findings demonstrated that while researchers often do engage
with policymakers, this is often not systematic and that it is also hard
to quantify, track and assess the impact of these interactions.
Accordingly, they suggested some key recommendations to improve
engagement with policymakers going forwards:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Researchers would benefit from more education about the
policymaking process, as this will help them to target their
communication with policy stakeholders in a way that is more likely to
produce the desired uptakes of their research data.</p></li>
<li><p>Policy engagement needs to be better embedded into the research
culture of the organisation so that researchers are familiar with the
concept and terminology and are able to plan engagement activities as
part of their research practice.</p></li>
<li><p>Researchers should include policy engagement activities in their
grant applications and cost them accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>Researchers should be recognised for their policy engagement
work.</p></li>
<li><p>There needs to be a channel (or many channels) in place for
policy stakeholders to be able to access the research community, and a
corresponding channel in place for researchers to be able to access the
stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p>When thinking about systemic policy engagement, we do not need to
have the projects completed and research results in place before that
engagement takes place, and it is preferable if engagement is happening
throughout the entire research life cycle.</p></li>
<li><p>Policy engagement outputs should be centrally collected in a
systematic way, and regular reports produced.</p></li>

<h1>Scientific evidence and policy</h1>
<!-- 3-9 -->
<p>One of the ways policymakers identify effective policies and
interventions, and how best to implement them, is through scientific
evidence. Yet those who produce scientific knowledge are often trained
to communicate with fellow specialists and not with non-academic
audiences. It is important for researchers and scientists engaged in
policy-related work to develop the skills needed to effectively
communicate the value of their research to policymakers.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the policy community </strong></p>
<p>The policy process is complex, involving a range of actors within and
outside government who play diverse roles in initiating, formulating,
implementing, and evaluating policies. Communicators must identify the
various stakeholders in the policy process and learn how to segment and
analyse audiences that make up the policy community.</p>
<p><strong>Clarifying the purposes of policy communication</strong></p>
<p>The policy process involves a series of stages. Those who want to
influence policy must first understand the policy cycle, the various
purposes relating to each phase of the cycle, and the form of
communication best suited to each purpose. This includes the different
stages involved in the policy cycle, the process of policy communication
(target, rationale, benefit, expected outcomes of communication, etc.),
and how to identify the type of communication needed in the continuum of
engagement (e.g. informing, consulting, collaborating, deciding,
disseminating).</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the communication needs of policy
stakeholders</strong></p>
<p>The uptake of research depends on several factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The four key characteristics that make information useful to
policy:</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To help to solve problems</p></li>
<li><p>To be actionable</p></li>
<li><p>To have consequences</p></li>
<li><p>To be publicly accessible</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>The need to identify relevant scientific evidence to address
questions raised in the policy space.</p></li>
<li><p>How to adapt scientific evidence to suit policymakers.</p></li>
<li><p>How to strengthen links between policy actors and those who want
to share scientific evidence.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Techniques and tools of engagement</strong></p>
<p>There are tactics and tools available to effectively engage
audiences, ranging from those suited to face-to-face interactions
(e.g. public, and private meetings, forums, festivals, town hall
meetings, policy durbars, consultative group meetings, workshops) to
mediated forms of communication (traditional media, websites, social
media, etc). Effective communication must consider which platforms and
tools to use in communicating scientific evidence to policymakers and
other stakeholders. It is important to have communication strategies and
plans, engagement techniques (e.g. planning and facilitating public
consultations and debates, soliciting media coverage, convening press
conferences), and the knowledge and skills required to produce press
releases and policy documents such as policy briefs, memoranda, and
communique.</p>
<p><strong>Familiar challenges in policy communication</strong></p>

into policy and practice (GRIPP)</a> requires scientists to communicate
evidence to policymakers in ways that can lead to decisions and action.
Not only must research be relevant, but the language of engagement must

communication including language/translation, cultural barriers,
audience scepticism and the importance of compelling storytelling to
drive home the message.</p>

<h1>Research and public health</h1>
<!-- 3-11 -->
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of positive
interaction between public health agencies and academia, as well as
industry, journalism, and even unconventional information sources
(e.g. social networks).</p>
<p>Countries, where good relationships between academia and public
health agencies existed, took quicker and more effective resolutions
during the pandemic, whereas those with less auspicious relationships
based their decisions on non-scientific, often politically led opinions.
For example, in Latin America (one of the regions in the world that were
most affected by COVID-19), <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m3575">Uruguay</a> involved academics
in the early-pandemic strategies, by integrating universities and
research centres into diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment
assessments. This allowed them to control quickly COVID-19 transmission,
reaching outstanding low levels of infections and mortality in 2020. In
the same region, Uruguay´s neighbours Brazil and Argentina (that used a
political, non-academic based approach) counted the infections in
millions and the mortality in hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p><strong>Indirect communication</strong></p>
<p>Academia has an important role in training the public health workers
that will be part of the public health agencies and health ministries.
Education at undergraduate and postgraduate levels should be continuous
to provide state-of-the-art tools to public health authorities in order
for them to make good decisions. This also means that communication
between academia and health agencies continues indirectly through
education.</p>
<p>Another major role of academia in public health is to conduct
research (basic and applied) that can be useful for decision-making.
Even though public health authorities are responsible for taking
decisions, they should be built on systematically acquired results. This
type of indirect communication between academia and government health
agencies should be encouraged, as research evidence is the most powerful
instrument to fully understand and try to solve a problem that affects
the general population.</p>
<p>Finally, <a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221242/">academia should
engage with the community</a>, to understand public health problems and
effectively communicate science. However, one of the main challenges
faced by researchers, and public health officials, during the current
pandemic is effective communication with the public, so that the reasons
behind public health policy are understood.</p>
<p><strong>Direct communication</strong></p>
<p>Communication between academia and ministries of health often
develops from already existing contacts and relationships. It is vital
that trustworthy communication is established prior to a public health
emergency (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) as, without bidirectional
interaction, important information may not be properly communicated.
Trust is the base of any communication, and reliance depends on the
interlocutors and their communication lines. For example, is more
difficult to build effective communication channels in countries with
weak public health institutions that change authorities repeatedly,
compared with those with long-term strategies. Likewise, in countries
with a weak academic culture, it will be difficult for their public
health agencies to find a continuous and reliable interlocutor.</p>
<p>Academics advise public health authorities and policymakers on
up-to-date evidence and data interpretation, and, additionally, they can
also offer personal opinions based on experience. However, authorities
must recognize when they are getting one or the other. Information
provided by academics must be transparent and free of conflicts of
interest, and it also should be open to public scrutiny in terms of
getting different expert opinions when it is considered necessary.
Public health agencies also need to be open to receiving advice,
especially during a public health emergency, as this will facilitate
academic work such as research and education.</p>
<p>The last responsibility of academia is to give feedback (and
criticism when necessary) on the decisions taken by public health
agencies and ministries of health. Academia plays an important role in
seeking evidence to determine if a decision was taken accurately or not.
That was probably the most difficult task for researchers during the
COVID-19 pandemic, as when criticised, some authorities ignored
academics, blocked their research work, or even limited their free
speech. It is undeniable that academia played an important role during
the pandemic, however, most of its valuable work was diluted due to not
interacting successfully with public health agencies.</p>

<h1>Health policy lessons from COVID-19</h1>
<!-- 3-12  -->
<p>The best way to learn how to engage with policymakers is to listen to
the experiences of scientists who have worked closely with them and from
policymakers themselves. Read below the answers from experienced
professionals.</p>
<p><strong>What are the main challenges in communicating with
policymakers?</strong></p>
<p>In countries where political crises are not uncommon and institutions
are weak, a big challenge is the constant change of policymakers,
authorities and civil servants. Researchers might describe detailed
scientific information when engaging with policymakers, which might not
be useful to the policymaker as they are more concerned with actionable
research that can be translated into policy; so knowledge transfer has
to be strengthened between the two sectors.</p>
<p>Another big challenge is that in several countries in Latin America,
there is no formal system for scientific advising (this is no formal and
regular communication channels between academia and policymakers), which
has resulted in a lack of trust between these groups. As a result, in
countries where this is an issue, engagement with policymakers has to be
approached differently.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge the scientists and public health professionals
face is establishing effective communication with authorities because it
also depends on them. This means that even if you are willing to
collaborate, and policymakers don’t accept suggestions, communication
won’t be possible. For that reason, authorities need to understand they
can ask for advice from researchers, especially when they lack the
necessary expertise within their authority.</p>
<p>There are key challenges in engaging with policy stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Difficulty in getting approvals, and administrative
burdens</p></li>
<li><p>Stakeholders’ limited capacity and infrastructure to collaborate
in research</p></li>
<li><p>Different priorities than researchers</p></li>
<li><p>High turnover among staff at stakeholder institutions</p></li>
<li><p>Stakeholder time constraints</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the key learnings from interactions with
policymakers during the pandemic?</strong></p>
<p>As evidence changes over time, conveying how this may affect policy
decisions is crucial. It’s important to communicate that the information
you shared with them is the most current evidence but can change over
time, and the advice might need to be revised periodically.</p>
<p>Lessons learnt from the management of pandemic crises in advisory
boards include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The strongest engagements were those where the scientists were
able to provide rapid technical advice to policy stakeholders with whom
they already had an existing relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>Bringing together multiple stakeholders for a single meeting was
very challenging because stakeholders were over-committed.</p></li>
<li><p>Stakeholders need engagement and advice during an emergency in a
very fast timeframe - which provides a considerable burden for
researchers in the emergency response.</p></li>
<li><p>Stakeholders preferred to engage in short, online
meetings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Clarity around the benefits and costs of implementing a policy can
help communications. This should be balanced with discussions about the
costs and consequences of not action on the evidence.</p>
<p>It’s helpful if interactions with policymakers are part of
wider/general collaboration framework. However, many government
organisations will require signing Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs),
collaboration agreements or some sort of formal link.</p>
<p><strong>What is the advice to other researchers in communicating with
policymakers?</strong></p>
<p>Policy engagement is a communication exercise, and it is most
effective when it is two-way. This means that researchers need to
provide opportunities for policy stakeholders to engage with them and be
willing to listen and respond.</p>
<p>Policy stakeholders tend to ask to be involved or informed about
research at very early stages. They do not want to dictate the research
agenda, but they do want to be sure that research is designed in ways
that can produce useful outcomes for policy. The best way to do this is
to find ways to build consultation into research throughout the research
lifecycle.</p>
<p>Partnering with civil society organisations and advocacy groups to
work on the specific subject is recommended. This can help have a
stronger message delivery mechanism. Identifying local champions can
boost the delivery of these messages.</p>
<p>Another helpful way to maintain the engagement is to establish a
structure to feed into policymaking (e.g. establish annual meetings or
spaces for regular dialogue with policymakers and government
committees).</p>
<p>As a final piece of advice, try to give the stakeholders key points
of action to work with. Try not to load them with vast amounts of
evidence, summarise findings and suggest solutions instead.</p>

<h1>Impacting public health policy</h1>
<!-- 3-13 -->
<p>Public health policy requires individuals from many disciplines to
collect as much useful data as possible, analyse and interpret it, and
communicate it to decision-makers who will then use it to set government
policies.</p>
<p>Under ordinary circumstances, setting these policies is a balancing
act between competing interests; scientists, civil servants and
government officials must work together to find solutions that are both
effective and acceptable to the public.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic crashed into this finely balanced system with
little warning. New people, institutions and data needed to be brought
urgently into the policy process. In the United Kingdom, this included
an unprecedented level of genomic pathogen surveillance data to
complement information about case testing, hospital capacity, and
deaths. From very early in the pandemic, the UK used its strength in
pathogen genomics to build a national surveillance system that could
detect new mutations in the virus and track their spread geographically.
This genomic surveillance swiftly provided insights into the <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.11.020">early evolution of the
virus</a>, but it wasn’t clear how these discoveries could meaningfully
influence policy. In the summer of 2020, local clusters of highly
similar genomes were observed from <a
href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-53652437">“superspreader”
events</a> during an otherwise quiet time in the pandemic in the UK, but
because the sequences were only available a few weeks after the events
occurred, there was no opportunity for public health action.</p>
<p>The value of genomic surveillance in the UK became apparent in
December 2020, when an otherwise unexplained increase in cases in Kent,
in South East England, was discovered to be due to a <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/03/has-everyone-in-kent-gone-to-illegal-rave-on-variant-trail-with-covid-detectives">new
variant (later dubbed the ‘Alpha’ variant) of the Coronavirus</a>. The
team of academic and public health scientists who discovered the new
variant alerted the broader pandemic science policy community. Within
ten days, an unimaginably short time in the usual process of scientific
discovery, the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, imposed strict
restrictions on social mixing during the Christmas holiday in large
parts of England. By early January 2021, it was clear that the Alpha
variant had spread widely in the UK, and a second national lockdown was
required.</p>
<p>The Alpha variant, along with the simultaneous discovery of the Beta
variant in South Africa, moved genomic surveillance from a niche
interest among scientists to one of the most prominent data streams in
pandemic policymaking. Would new variants spread so easily that
lockdowns couldn’t contain them? Would they cause more severe disease?
Could they evade the protection offered by vaccines?</p>
<p>The UK Health Security Agency needed to coordinate these data to
provide timely, understandable, actionable input for policymakers. They
convened a Variant Technical Group to serve as a regular forum for
academic and public health scientists to use genomic surveillance data
to improve the modelling of future waves, evaluate new variants in
laboratory tests, and determine their effect on vaccines. The group
regularly published <a
href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-sars-cov-2-variants-technical-briefings">technical
reports</a> to ensure scientists and policymakers around the world had
access to the latest research. A number of public-facing <a
href="https://covid19.sanger.ac.uk/">websites</a> were created to share
anonymised genomic surveillance data in near real-time, thus allowing
members of the press and public to see the new variant data that was
being used to influence policy on travel, local restrictions and vaccine
and treatment roll-out. This public focus also led to active (and
sometimes vitriolic) debates on social media about policy responses to
new variants of the virus. Organisations like the <a
href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/">Science Media Centre</a>
helped to coordinate academics unaccustomed to that level of attention
to share information so the press could accurately report on new
developments.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique challenge to science
communication for public health policy. This included, for the first
time, building a genomic surveillance system for a new pathogen,
continuously improving the speed and interpretability of the
intelligence it produced, and creating new channels of communication
from scientists to policymakers. While created in emergency
circumstances, there is now an opportunity to build a sustainable way
for genomic surveillance to aid public health policy.</p>

<h1>COVID-19 in the European Union</h1>
<!-- 3-15 -->
<p>Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the European Union (EU) has worked
with its member states to protect the health and well-being of EU
citizens. Nevertheless, EU institutions have limited authority in the
health system of each member state, as, instead, their primary role is
to make recommendations and coordinate joint action.</p>
<p>In March 2020, four priorities to guide the EU’s emergency response
to the COVID-19 pandemic were determined. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Limiting the spread of the virus</p></li>
<li><p>Ensuring the provision of medical equipment, particularly masks
and respirators</p></li>
<li><p>Promoting research for treatments and vaccines</p></li>
<li><p>Tackling the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to limit the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the EU’s
external borders were temporarily closed and non-essential travel to the
EU was restricted.</p>
<p>To meet the need for emergency medical equipment, in March 2020, the
EU created a reserve of medical equipment which could be quickly
mobilised in emergencies. At the same time, the EU enabled its member
states to participate in joint public procurement tenders for protective
gear, ventilators and testing kits. The EU’s Emergency Response
Coordination Centre (ERCC) then, via its EU Civil Protection Mechanism,
processed requests and coordinated the distribution of equipment and
support to the countries which needed it most. The EU has also
coordinated with European industry to increase production and has
regulated the export of key supplies from the EU to third countries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to promote research for treatments and vaccines,
research funds and financial support were deployed to develop treatments
and vaccines. The European <a
href="https://www.covid19dataportal.org/">COVID-19 Data Platform</a> was
launched to enable the rapid collection and sharing of available
research data.</p>
<p><strong>The EU Vaccines Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The development and distribution of safe and effective vaccines
against COVID-19 represented a cornerstone of the EU’s response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The EU Vaccines Strategy was presented on 17 June
2020 to accelerate the development, manufacturing and deployment of
vaccines against COVID-19. The EU coordinated a joint effort to secure
the production and delivery of a sufficient quantity of vaccines to its
member states, who received the vaccines under the same conditions and
at the same time. The COVID-19 vaccination campaigns started on 27
December 2020 across the Union. By December 2022, eight out of ten
adults in the EU population (82%) were fully vaccinated against
COVID-19. The European Medicines Agency has so far authorised seven
COVID-19 vaccines for use within the EU.</p>
<p><strong>Global cooperation</strong></p>
<p>On 4 May 2020, the Coronavirus Global Response Initiative was
launched, following the global call for action launched by the World
Health Organization (WHO) on 24 April 2020. This initiative aimed to
make COVID-19 treatment, tests and vaccines available worldwide. Despite
the name, the Coronavirus Global Response also has the broader aims of
strengthening health systems everywhere and supporting economic recovery
in the world’s most fragile regions and communities.</p>
<p>On 18 September 2020, the European Commission confirmed its
participation in the <a href="https://www.gavi.org/covax-facility">COVAX
Facility</a> for equitable access to affordable COVID-19 vaccines. COVAX
is part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a global
collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable
access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. Team Europe (formed
by the EU and its member states) is one of the lead donors of COVAX.</p>
<p><strong>Pandemic preparedness</strong></p>
<p>The European Commission established the <a
href="https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/departments-and-executive-agencies/health-emergency-preparedness-and-response-authority_en">Health
Emergency and Response Authority (HERA)</a> to tackle all areas of
health preparedness, including detection, prevention, research,
international cooperation, response, investment, and the fight against
disinformation.</p>
<p>In December 2022, HERA and WHO launched a new partnership to boost
capacities at national, regional, and global levels for better
preparedness for and response to health emergencies. Within this
partnership, HERA will fund four global initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Supporting the scaling up of national capacities for SARS-CoV-2
and emerging pathogens detection, including genomic surveillance in
Africa</p></li>
<li><p>The COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) to ensure a
successful global effort to develop and facilitate access to
technologies to fight COVID-19</p></li>
<li><p>Epidemic and pandemic intelligence, including access to and
sharing of data and analytics through the WHO Hub for Pandemic and
Epidemic Preparedness</p></li>
<li><p>Research to address antimicrobial resistance (AMR)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Through this programme, HERA and WHO will strengthen global
capacities to detect, prevent, and respond to global health threats by
providing information, capacities, and tools against health
emergencies.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is remarkable for not only how fast the disease
spread around the globe, but also how fast existing technologies were
repurposed and new approaches were developed to tackle the disease.</p>
<p>In this video, Prof Christine Carrington, Dr Emma Hodcroft, Dr
Richard Orton and Dr Thanat Chookajorn share the main lessons they
learnt from COVID-19.</p>
